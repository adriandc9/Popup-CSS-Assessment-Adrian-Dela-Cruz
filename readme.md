Hello! Welcome to our CSS technical assessment. Below we will outline the general guidelines for the assessment, what we are looking for, and how to navigate the exercise.

# Overview

The goal of this technical challenge is to assess your ability to write CSS to create beautiful popups.

**Your goal is to make the popup in this preview look as much like the popup in `popup_spec.png` as you can.**

# Steps

1. Make sure you are logged in! On the top left you will see that you need to be logged in to save your changes. This is necessary for us to see the changes you make.
2. Fork this assessment. Use the button on the top, and add your name in the title. For example "Popup CSS Assesment â€” Jerry Walters"
3. Read through these instructions.
4. Write some CSS! The goal is for you to spend a maximum of 30 minutes to 1 hour writing CSS to make your popup look like the image in `popup_spec.png`
5. Share the link to your completed assessment with us!

# What are we evaluating?

We will be evaluating this assessment based on a few criteria:

1. Visual accuracy

- How much does your popup look like the popup in the spec?
- Attention to detail. Do you notice the little things from the design?
- The closer the better, but we understand you don't have access to the exact colors used, so use your best judgement.

2. Code quality

- What is the quality of the CSS written?
- Is there a simpler or more modern way to accomplish what you are doing?
- Don't be afraid to leave comments to explain why you did something a certain way.

## Notes

- Use `popup_spec.png` as your reference image.
- All of your work should be completed in `candidateStyles.css`
- Again, do not edit the `index.html` or `baseStlyes.css` files! They both contain CSS you will have to contend with to emulate a realistic popup editing experience.
